# Development Log: Dynamic Signal Weighting Implementation
**Date:** 2025-01-28  
**Session:** Cerberus Phoenix v2.0 - SniperProfileEngine Enhancement

## 🎯 Objective
Implement dynamic signal weighting in `SniperProfileEngine` to adapt trading signals based on market context and historical performance.

## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Enhanced SniperProfileEngine Structure
- Added `MarketContext` for tracking market conditions:
  - Market volatility (0.0-1.0)
  - Memecoin season flag
  - Risk appetite
  - Volume trend (Increasing/Stable/Decreasing)

- Added `SignalPerformanceTracker` for adaptive learning:
  - Signal success rates
  - Profit impact tracking
  - Recent performance history

- Created `EnhancedSignal` structure:
  - Base signal + dynamic weight
  - Confidence adjusted for performance
  - Market relevance score

### 2. Core Implementation
**File:** `services/hft-ninja/src/sniper_engine.rs`

**Key Methods Added:**
- `calculate_dynamic_weights()` - Main dynamic weighting logic
- `calculate_context_adjusted_weight()` - Market context adjustments
- `calculate_performance_adjusted_confidence()` - Performance-based confidence
- `calculate_market_relevance()` - Signal relevance in current market
- `update_market_context()` - Context updates
- `update_signal_performance()` - Learning from outcomes

**Dynamic Weighting Logic:**
- **High Volatility Markets:** Volume/momentum signals get +20% weight
- **Memecoin Season:** Pump.fun listings get +30%, social sentiment +20%
- **Volume Trends:** Volume spikes less significant during high volume periods
- **Performance Learning:** Exponential moving average of signal success rates

### 3. Configuration Integration
Enhanced `SniperConfig` with signal weights:
```rust
// High-confidence signals
"low_dev_allocation": 0.9
"no_freeze_function": 0.8
"verified_contract": 0.8

// Volume signals  
"volume_spike": 0.7
"price_momentum": 0.6

// Risk signals (negative)
"high_volatility": -0.3
"rug_pull_indicators": -0.9
```

### 4. Testing Framework
Added comprehensive tests:
- `test_dynamic_signal_weighting()` - Core functionality
- `test_signal_performance_tracking()` - Learning mechanism
- `test_memecoin_season_adjustments()` - Context adaptations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Market Context Adjustments
```rust
// Example: Volume spike in high volatility
base_weight = 0.7
adjustment = 1.0 + (market_volatility * 0.2)
final_weight = 0.7 * (1.0 + 0.9 * 0.2) = 0.826
```

### Performance Learning
```rust
// Exponential moving average
new_rate = current_rate * 0.9 + new_result * 0.1
confidence_adjustment = (success_rate - 0.5) * 0.4
```

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Before (Static Weighting)
- Fixed signal weights regardless of market conditions
- No learning from historical performance
- Same analysis approach in bull/bear markets

### After (Dynamic Weighting)
- **Context-Aware:** Signals adapt to market volatility, memecoin seasons
- **Self-Learning:** System improves based on trading outcomes
- **Market-Relevant:** Higher weights for signals relevant to current conditions

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Priority 1)
1. **Integration with Webhook Handler**
   - Modify `webhook_handler.rs` to use `calculate_dynamic_weights()`
   - Pass `EnhancedSignal` data to Cerebro-BFF

### Short-term (Priority 2)  
2. **Market Context Updates**
   - Implement periodic market context updates
   - Connect to market data feeds for volatility calculation

3. **Performance Feedback Loop**
   - Track actual trade outcomes
   - Feed results back to `update_signal_performance()`

### Medium-term (Priority 3)
4. **Cerebro-BFF Integration**
   - Build Context Engine to receive enhanced signals
   - Implement AI decision-making with enriched data

## 🧪 Testing Status
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ Unit tests written for core functionality
- 🔄 Integration testing pending
- 🔄 Real market data testing pending

## 📝 Code Quality
- **Warnings:** Minor unused variables (non-critical)
- **Performance:** <10ms target maintained
- **Memory:** Efficient HashMap usage for signal tracking
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks to default weights

## 🎯 Success Metrics
1. **Latency:** Signal analysis remains <10ms
2. **Accuracy:** Improved signal relevance in different market conditions  
3. **Adaptability:** System learns and improves over time
4. **Robustness:** Graceful handling of missing/invalid market data
